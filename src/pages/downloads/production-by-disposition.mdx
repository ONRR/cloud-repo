# Production disposition by Month

This dataset contains information on natural resource production disposition volumes from ONRR’s OGOR-B form. These volumes come from production of Native American minerals and U.S federal minerals on both land (onshore) and water (offshore). This data is available from January 2003 through the most recently available month, which is usually 3-4 months prior to the current month.

This dataset contains monthly information on the disposition of production for each product (oil and gas) produced. The product could have been directly removed/sold, directly used (injected), moved off the lease, transferred to a different facility, flared, spilled and/or lost, lost through evaporation/shrinkage, etc.

## Scope

This dataset includes natural resource production for U.S. federal minerals for both onshore and offshore areas and Native American minerals. This dataset does not include privately owned minerals or U.S. state minerals.

Federal production data is available by location, but Native American data is only available at the national level to protect private and personally identifiable information.

The dataset currently includes data tracked and managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). The production disposition data for Oil and Gas is collected on Form ONRR-4054-B (Oil and Gas Operations Report, Part B).
## Data publication

We update this production data every month, but final production numbers aren't available for 3-4 months. For example, the most recent production data for a file updated in November will be from July or August.

### Fields and definitions

** Production Date**  The date in which the production occurred.
<br />

**Land Class**  This field distinguishes federal lands and waters from Native American lands.

* **Federal**  [Federal lands](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42346.pdf) are owned by or under the jurisdiction of the federal government, including: public domain lands, acquired lands, military acquired lands, and [Outer Continental Shelf](https://www.boem.gov/OCS-Lands-Act-History/).
* **Native American**  includes Tribal lands held in trust by the federal government for a tribe’s use, and allotments held in trust by the federal government for individual Native American use.
<br />

**Land Category**  This field distinguishes between onshore and offshore production.

* **Onshore**  Situated or occurring on land
* **Offshore**  Submerged lands located farther than three miles off a state’s coastline, or three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico off of Texas and Western Florida
<br />

**Commodity** We have monthly data for oil, gas, and coal, since these are high-volume commodities that result in the most revenue. This field includes the units for each commodity in parentheses.

  - **Oil Prod Vol (bbl)**  Oil production, measured in barrels (bbl)
  - **Gas Prod Vol (Mcf)**  Gas (natural gas), measured in thousand cubic feet (Mcf)


**Volume**  Shows the production volume (amount produced). The units for volume are shown in the preceding field (Commodity).
