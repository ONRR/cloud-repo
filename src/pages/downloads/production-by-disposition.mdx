# Production disposition by Month

This dataset contains information on natural resource production disposition volumes from ONRR’s OGOR-B form. These volumes come from production of Native American minerals and U.S federal minerals on both land (onshore) and water (offshore). This data is available from January 2003 through the most recently available month, which is usually 3-4 months prior to the current month.

This dataset contains monthly information on the disposition of production for each product (oil and gas) produced. The product could have been directly removed/sold, directly used (injected), moved off the lease, transferred to a different facility, flared, spilled and/or lost, lost through evaporation/shrinkage, etc.

## Scope

This dataset includes natural resource production for U.S. federal minerals for both onshore and offshore areas and Native American minerals. This dataset does not include privately owned minerals or U.S. state minerals.

Federal production data is available by location, but Native American data is only available at the national level to protect private and personally identifiable information.

The dataset currently includes data tracked and managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). The production disposition data for Oil and Gas is collected on Form ONRR-4054-B (Oil and Gas Operations Report, Part B).
## Data publication

We update this production data every month, but final production numbers aren't available for 3-4 months. For example, the most recent production data for a file updated in November will be from July or August.

## About the data

A note about “Mixed Exploratory” versus “Federal” categories of production

To build our data visualizations, we've aggregated production from two types of jurisdictions: “federal” and “mixed exploratory.”

**Federal production** is production from federal onshore and offshore minerals.

**“Mixed exploratory”** is a temporary jurisdictional unit that provides for the exploration and development of an entire geologic structure or area consisting of federal and/or Native American minerals, with other mineral ownership, so that drilling and production may proceed in the most efficient and economic manner.

## Data dictionary

### Fields and definitions

** Production Date**  The date in which the production occurred.
<br />

**Land Class**  This field distinguishes federal lands and waters from Native American lands.

* **Federal**  includes Federal minerals that are owned by or under the jurisdiction of the federal government, including: public domain, acquired, military acquired, and [Outer Continental Shelf](https://www.boem.gov/OCS-Lands-Act-History/).
* **Native American**  includes Tribal minerals held in trust by the federal government for a tribe’s use, and allotments held in trust by the federal government for individual Native American use.
* **Mixed Exploratory** is a temporary jurisdictional unit that is used until production is proven on that location (see above).
<br />

**Land Category**  This field distinguishes between onshore and offshore production.

* **Onshore**  Situated or occurring on land
* **Offshore**  Submerged lands located farther than three miles off a state’s coastline, or three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico off of Texas and Western Florida
<br />

**State** The state where the production occurred
<br />

**County** The county where the production occurred
<br />

**FIPS Code** Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code is a five-digit code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the U.S., certain U.S. possessions, and certain freely associated states. The first two digits are the FIPS state code and the last three are the county code within the state or possession.
<br />

**Offshore Region** BOEM separates offshore areas into four regions: Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Pacific, and Alaska. For more information on offshore regions, including spatial boundaries, see BOEM's [maps and GIS data](http://www.boem.gov/Maps-and-GIS-Data/).
<br />

**Disposition Code** This field is a two-digit code indicating the means of product removal from the report entity.
<br />

**Disposition Description** This field describes how the oil or gas is used and/or where it goes.
<br />

**Commodity** Products are listed individually but may also fall into like categories.

  - **Oil Prod Vol (bbl)**  Oil production, measured in barrels (bbl)
  - **Gas Prod Vol (Mcf)**  Gas (natural gas), measured in thousand cubic feet (Mcf)


**Volume**  Shows the production volume (amount produced). The units for volume are shown in the preceding field (Commodity).
